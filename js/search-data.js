The BAM Calculator follows the rules and calculations outlined in the BAM, and assists the user in applying the BAM at a site and generating an outcome. Users can apply the BAM and use the BAM Calculator to assess development proposals and estimate credit generation at biodiversity stewardship sites. These proposals can be based on survey data collected using the BAM field survey methods or on estimated data. The BAM Calculator contains all biodiversity data for New South Wales that is available in BioNet, the department's repository for biodiversity data products. The BAM Calculator has biodiversity data from all IBRA regions, all plant community types (PCT) and all ecosystem credit species and species credit species.

    "content": "Purpose of this guide Biodiversity Assessment Method Calculator Scope and structure of the guide Purpose of this guide The NSW Biodiversity Offsets Scheme (the scheme) is the framework for offsetting unavoidable impacts on biodiversity from development with biodiversity gains achieved at biodiversity stewardship sites. The scheme is supported by the Biodiversity Assessment Method (BAM 2020). The BAM 2020 establishes a transparent, consistent and scientifically based approach for assessing impacts to, or improvements in, biodiversity. It outlines how an accredited person (assessor) assesses impacts on biodiversity at development sites and stewardship sites. The BAM 2020 is operationalised by the Biodiversity Assessment Method Calculator (BAM-C), which is an online interactive tool. Assessors (persons accredited to apply the BAM under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (BC Act)) must use the BAM-C for the purpose of carrying out an assessment using the BAM 2020. The Biodiversity Assessment Method Calculator User Guide (the guide) provides detailed step-by-step instructions and technical advice for assessors when using the BAM-C. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (the department) will review and update the guide periodically to incorporate new information and reflect legislative or policy changes. Biodiversity Assessment Method Calculator The BAM-C uses the rules and calculations outlined in the BAM 2020 and allows the user to apply the BAM 2020 at a site and observe the results of the assessment. The BAM-C helps with preparation of standardised reports and allows assessors to enter field data and determine the number and class of biodiversity credits. The vegetation integrity (VI) and habitat suitability assessments are used to calculate the number and class of biodiversity credits to offset impacts at development/clearing sites or to establish biodiversity stewardship agreements at stewardship sites. The BAM-C uses biodiversity data from the NSW BioNet Threatened Biodiversity Data Collection (TBDC) and BioNet Vegetation Classification (Veg-C) to perform BAM 2020 calculations. Assessors and consent authorities can access the BAM-C via the Biodiversity Offsets and Agreement Management System (BOAMS). Scope and structure of the guide The guide outlines step-by-step instructions for completing each phase of the BAM 2020 assessment within the BAM-C. It also provides tips and other useful information to support its application (blue boxes). The guide should be used in association with the BAM 2020 operational manuals (Stages 1–3). See Appendix B below for links to these and other useful documents and webpages mentioned in this guide. The guide does not contain detailed instructions for using BOAMS. Refer to the BOAMS user guides (for assessors or community users) for more information (see Appendix B). Where relevant, this guide will outline specific BOAMS prerequisites that will impact using the BAM-C. A registered user version accessed via a BOAMS login, which allows assessors to save assessments and generate and download reports that display the results of assessments a public version with no login required, however, data cannot be saved or viewed as a downloadable report. info Tip A public version of the BAM-C is available, but it is intended for demonstration purposes only and has limited functionality (for example, users cannot save data or print reports). For ease of use, the guide has a chapter dedicated to each assessment type: Chapter 4: Development/clearing assessments – Part 4 Developments (General), Major Projects, Part 5 Activities, Biocertification, and Clearing (General) Chapter 5: Small area assessments – Part 4 Development (Small Area) and Part 5 Development (Small Area) Chapter 6: Scattered Trees Chapter 7: Stewardship (for offset sites). The intention is to provide standalone information in each of these chapters to enable the user to follow the instructions specific to a particular assessment type. The guide is aligned with the number ‘tab’ structure of the BAM-C and provides: the purpose of the tab a brief description of the steps needed to complete an assessment references to relevant sections of the BAM 2020 and other useful information.

Click ‘New stewardship assessment’ or ‘New development/clearing assessment’, as appropriate. Add a subject and description and click ‘Confirm’. This will create a parent case that will then open. Note: Choose a useful subject name and description so you can distinguish between multiple cases. Click ‘Create Assessment’ to create a related case and access the BAM-C. The related case will have identical ‘Subject’ and ‘Description’ information to the parent case. When multiple related cases (assessments) are created it is good practice to re-name the related cases to readily distinguish between parent and related cases, and also between related cases. To navigate back to the parent case at any time, click on the link under ‘Related Parent Cases’. Open the BAM-C by clicking ‘BAM Calculator’. Tab 1 in the BAM-C will open. info Tip Issues with accessing or launching the BAM-C The Google Chrome web browser is recommended for access to BOAMS and the BAM-C. The BAM-C will not load in the Safari web browser. The BOAMS case owner has full edit access to the BAM-C assessment, but other assessor case parties have limited access (see BAM-C user access ). If you cannot see the row of general functions buttons (see General Functions ), you may be using the public version of the BAM-C, or your session has timed out.

Tick the ‘Linear Development’ checkbox if the development is linear-shaped. Linear-shaped development is generally narrow and extends across the landscape, for example, major roads and rail lines. Reference data version – The revised Eastern NSW PCT Classification has been deployed into the BAM-C, and revisions to the remainder of the state will be rolled out over the coming years. The reference data version may have different options available depending on when the assessment was created and which IBRA region is selected. Instructions are provided for the following scenarios: New assessments inside a revised NSW IBRA region All new assessments created after deployment of a revised NSW PCT classification will automatically use the revised NSW PCTs when an associated NSW IBRA region is selected. The only option in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down will be ‘Current classification (live – default)’. Existing assessments inside a newly revised NSW IBRA region Reopening ‘Open’, ‘Locked’ or ‘Finalised’ assessments created before deployment of a newly revised NSW PCT classification will trigger an update with the revised NSW PCTs. This will trigger an alert detailing the changes that have occurred in the assessment. info Tip Take a screenshot of the alert showing the updates. Alerts will not display again once the case has been saved. To use legacy PCTs during a transitional period, select the legacy classification in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down. Alternatively, to use the revised NSW PCTs select ‘Current classification (live – default)’. To progress an assessment with revised data, the following tabs may require amendment: Tab 3 – Vegetation Tab 4 – Habitat suitability: Predicted Tab 5 – Habitat suitability: Candidate Tab 6 – Habitat Survey New or existing assessments outside a revised NSW IBRA region New or existing assessments outside of a newly revised NSW IBRA region will not update with new NSW PCTs, as they are not relevant. The only available option in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down will be ‘Current classification (live – default)’. info Tip Further information on transitional arrangements is available from the New vegetation integrity benchmarks and plant community types webpage (see Appendix B). When a transitional period ends, the only option in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down will be ‘Current classification (live – default)’. At this time, revised NSW PCTs must be used for all assessments within the associated NSW IBRA regions. Clear your browser cache to ensure any newly revised NSW PCTs and the legacy reference data version display correctly in the drop-down. Clearing the BAM-C cache – If you are having a problem selecting legacy PCTs (during a transitional period) in a case created before deployment of any revised NSW PCTs, clear your cache in the BAM-C. See Appendix A of this guide for instructions on clearing the cache. info Tip If you cannot clear the cache to see the legacy classification in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down, contact the BOS Help Desk for assistance. The ‘Landscape features’ field can be left blank when no listed landscape features are associated with the site. If a landscape feature is associated with the site, use the landscape ‘Feature’ drop-down to select the type of landscape feature associated with the site. Enter the name of the landscape feature in the ‘Name’ field. Tick the checkbox in the ‘Part of development footprint’ column if the feature is within the development footprint. Click ‘Add another landscape feature’ to accept the entered data. This will add another landscape feature row, which can be left blank if there are no other landscape features. If you need to remove a landscape feature, click ‘Remove’ in the ‘Action’ column. When all required information has been entered, click ‘Next’ to move to Tab 3. info Tip Once ‘Next’ is clicked, the IBRA region for the assessment is locked. To change the IBRA region, cancel or exit the assessment before saving and reopen the assessment. If the IBRA region is incorrect and the case has been saved, delete the assessment and create a new assessment through BOAMS (using the same parent case). Click ‘Next’ to move to the next tab to ensure subsequent tabs contain the correct information and calculations. "

    "content": "Resources 4.3 Vegetation (Tab 3) The ‘Vegetation’ tab is used to record the PCT(s) present on the site and to capture individual plot data that is used to calculate the VI scores for each vegetation zone. The method for recording PCTs and TECs at a site and calculating current vegetation condition of a site is the same for all assessment types. Refer to Chapter 4 of the BAM 2020 for further information. On this page 4.3.1 Define the PCTs and TECs 4.3.2 Import vegetation zones 4.3.3 Manually enter vegetation zone data 4.3.4 Calculate vegetation integrity for sites with multiple management zones 4.3.5 Calculate the future vegetation integrity score 4.3.1 Define the PCTs and TECs The ‘Vegetation’ tab will be open if ‘Next’ was clicked on Tab 2. When reopening an assessment with existing information, click on Tab 3 to open it. Note that if any of the tab headings are shaded in red, this indicates that action is required, or information needs to be entered/confirmed on that tab. Remember to click ‘Next’ to move through the tabs if any changes are made. If the PCT name or number is known, the ‘Plant community type’ field can be added as the first step, which will automatically populate the formation and class fields. If the PCT name or number is not known, use the ‘Formation’ drop-down to select the formation for the required PCT. info Tip If the PCT or number is known, enter this first and the formation and class fields will be populated automatically. Only PCTs associated with the IBRA region and IBRA subregion will be available. Refer to the webpage About BioNet Vegetation Classification (Veg-C) for further information about PCTs and TECs (see Appendix B). Use the ‘Class’ drop-down (if PCT name or number is not known) to select the required class. The classes available will be filtered to those associated with the formation if a formation was selected in step 3. Use the ‘Plant community type’ drop-down to select the required PCT. The PCTs available will be filtered to those associated with the class if a class was selected in step 4. The % cleared value for the PCT will be displayed under ‘PCT % cleared’. The % cleared value is an estimate of the extent to which a PCT has been cleared since European settlement and is used when assigning a non-threatened PCT to an offset trading group (OTG). info Tip • Detailed information on each PCT and its geographic distribution is available as a downloadable and refreshable Power Query from NSW BioNet Resources (see Appendix B), ‘BioNet Vegetation Classification’ > ‘Power Queries’ > ‘Plant Community Type data’.\n• Refer to the Offset rules and ecosystem credits guidance for more information on % cleared and OTGs (see Appendix B). Use the ‘Associated TEC’ drop-down to select the relevant TEC. If no TEC is associated with the PCT, select ‘Not a TEC’. info Tip Only TECs associated with the selected PCT (in BioNet) are shown in the drop-down. Where a TEC is present at the site but is unavailable in the drop-down list, it may be because the TEC is not associated with the IBRA region and IBRA subregion chosen. A detailed description of each TEC is available through the Threatened biodiversity profile search app (see Appendix B). Detailed information on the PCT to TEC associations and the applicable subregions is available as a downloadable and refreshable Power Query from the NSW BioNet Resources webpage (see Appendix B). ‘BioNet Vegetation Classification’ > ‘Power queries’ > ‘Threatened Ecological Community to Plant Community Types (PCT) Association data’. To request a review of a TEC association, contact the BOS Help Desk. The state and Commonwealth listing status of a TEC will be displayed under the ‘BC Act listing status’ and ‘EPBC Act listing status’ headings, respectively. Click ‘Add veg zone’. A vegetation zone record will be added to the following sections: ‘Vegetation zones (Current vegetation integrity score)’ ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’. info Tip Adding a unique condition class name to each vegetation zone will help you distinguish the vegetation zones throughout the assessment, especially when both a TEC and non-TEC have been identified on site for the same PCT. The future VI score fields display the remaining VI values after the development or clearing has occurred at a site. Edit this section only if partial loss of VI is occurring, rather than total loss. For PCTs with multiple vegetation zones, click ‘Add veg zone’ beside the applicable PCT to add another vegetation zone. A zone number will be generated for each vegetation zone and the relevant PCT number for each record displayed. Click ‘Add another PCT’ (if required) and repeat the above steps for additional PCTs. If the required PCT is missing from the PCT list, click ‘Search PCT outside IBRA’ and enter the name or PCT number to search and then select the PCT. Repeat the above steps for adding vegetation zones. info Tip You can only add PCTs that are associated with the selected IBRA region when you use the ‘Add Another PCT’ button. With I ‘Search PCT outside IBRA’ button you can add any approved PCT, not only those associated with the selected IBRA region. Some PCTs have no (or incomplete) benchmarks in Veg-C. For these PCTs, an error will be displayed, and the PCT cannot be used in the assessment. To delete a PCT or a vegetation zone click the button on the right under ‘Delete’. info Tip Vegetation zone and site data can be imported into the BAM-C in CSV file format (Subsection 4.3.2) or added manually (Subsection 4.3.3). See below for instructions. 4.3.2 Import vegetation zones To import vegetation zone data, click the import icon beside the vegetation zone. Download the CSV template by selecting ‘this template file’ in the import pop-up and an excel import data template will become available. Open and populate the template with observation values and save the template: row 1 of the template is reserved for headers row 2 of the template is reserved for example data users must enter plot data into the template from row 3 onwards Select and copy all column headings in rows 1 and 2 and the data from row 3 (and onwards if there is more than one plot). Make sure no blank columns or rows are selected. Click the import icon to reopen the ‘Import data’ pop-up (if not already open). Paste the copied data from the template into the ‘Import data’ pop-up and click ‘Import’. A pop-up will open asking you to confirm that all existing plots will be deleted. Click ‘Yes’ to delete any previous plot data or ‘No’ to cancel and retain the existing plot data. If the import was not successful, or only partially successful, the ‘Import data’ pop-up will display an error message. Correct the error(s) in the CSV file, then copy and paste the corrected data, and re-import. Click ‘Close’ to close the pop-up once the data has imported. The data will be imported into the relevant condition score pop-up fields and the scores will be calculated automatically. The condition score fields for each condition attribute will change from showing no score (indicated by an ellipsis) to showing a numeric score value. info Tip If assessing a non-woody PCT, do not specify any values for function attributes other than high threat weed (HTW) cover in the CSV import file. When copying the data from the template, ensure no extra columns are selected or an error will occur. To clear imported data, click the ‘Import’ icon to reopen the ‘Import’ pop-up. Click ‘Clear plots’. All imported data will be cleared and the condition score fields will revert to displaying no score (‘…’). The above process can be performed for all vegetation zones at the site (rather than on a zone-by-zone basis) using ‘Import site’ and following the same process outlined in steps 1–12 above. Individual zones can be removed by clicking the button on the right under ‘Delete’. 4.3.3 Manually enter vegetation zone data This section describes how to manually enter the vegetation zone data into the BAM-C to calculate the VI score. The ‘PCT code’ field is populated automatically when ‘Add veg zone’ is clicked. Select ‘Condition class’ and enter a condition class label for the zone. The name must not include spaces, but hyphens or underscores can be used as an alternative (for example, do not enter ‘Mod TEC’; instead use ‘Mod-TEC’ or ‘Mod_TEC’). info Tip Zone condition class is solely a label to help identify the zone and does not have any influence on VI or credit calculations. A vegetation zone name will be generated automatically based on the condition class and PCT code and displays under the ‘Vegetation zone name’ heading. Select ‘Patch Size’ and enter the relevant patch size area (in hectares) for the zone. info Tip The patch size value is used to filter the list of fauna species presented in the predicted and candidate species tabs. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 4.3.2 for more information on patch size. Making changes to the patch size value may affect data in the ‘Habitat suitability’, ‘Habitat survey’, ‘Credits’ and ‘Credit classes’ tabs. Enter the area for the vegetation zone in the ‘Area (ha)’ field. info Tip The area of a vegetation zone will determine the number of plots required. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 4.3.4 (Table 3). The BAM-C automatically adds the number of plots required based on the ‘Area (ha)’ entered. Ensure there is at least one vegetation zone for each PCT. Use the scroll bar to the right of the vegetation zone list to confirm each PCT has a vegetation zone. The minimum vegetation zone ‘Area (ha)’ is 0.01 ha. If a zone is smaller than this, the BAM-C will automatically round it up to 0.01 ha (values of 0.005–0.009 ha will be rounded up). If the area is less than 0.005 ha, consider adding the area to another vegetation zone. The ‘Patch size’ should be equal to or greater than the vegetation zone ‘Area (ha)’ size. Click the ‘Location’ icon and add plot location details. If additional plots are required, click ‘Add plot’. Once the required plot data has been added click ‘OK’. Note that adding a plot to the ‘Location’ field will also add a plot to the ‘Composition’, ‘Structure’ and ‘Function’ condition score fields. Select ‘Composition condition score’ and enter composition data. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update calculation of the composition score for the zone, or ‘OK’ to update and close the composition score pop-up. Select the ‘Calculation results’ tab on the ‘Zone composition data’ pop-up to see the underlying data used to calculate the score. Click ‘OK’. info Tip The following calculations are shown in the composition condition section: Benchmarks – these values indicate benchmark reference values for the vegetation class/IBRA combination of the zone. Observed mean – this is the average of observed values entered for all plots for a specific growth form group. Unweighted composition score – BAM-C calculates and displays the unweighted condition score for the relevant growth form group. This calculation converts observed mean values to continuous unweighted condition scores using a Weibull (continuous probability) distribution. Weighted composition score – BAM-C calculates and displays the weighted condition score for the relevant growth form group. This calculation applies a dynamic weighting based on the proportional contribution of each growth form group benchmark function to the benchmark total function (sum of benchmark function across all growth form groups). Dynamic weighting – BAM-C calculates and displays a dynamic weighting based on the proportional contribution of each growth form group benchmark condition attribute to the benchmark total condition (sum of benchmark condition attributes across all growth form groups). Weightings for structure and function are calculated using a similar approach. For further information on these weightings and calculations refer to Appendix H of the BAM 2020. For further information on determining the VI score refer to Appendix H of the BAM 2020. Select ‘Structure condition score’ to open the pop-up and repeat steps 8–11 above to calculate the structure score. info Tip The same calculations as those described for composition are performed for structure (see BAM 2020, Appendix H). Select ‘Function condition score’ to open the pop-up and repeat steps 8–11 above to calculate the structure score. Select the ‘Calculation results’ tab to see the underlying data used to calculate the score. info Tip Some fields in the function tab will be restricted based on the PCT selected. For example, for grassland PCTs the fields relating to trees will be greyed out. Weightings for function are static rather than dynamic, as defined in BAM 2020, Appendix H.3. Unwanted plot(s) can be removed by deleting them in the ‘Location’ pop-up. If you delete a plot, the applicable plot data will also be deleted from the composition, structure and function fields. After completing the composition, structure and function condition calculations, the current VI score will be displayed. 4.3.4 Calculate vegetation integrity for sites with multiple management zones(optional) Management zones can be added to an assessment to identify areas of a vegetation zone that will have different levels of impact (referred to as partial loss). Refer to Subsection 4.1.2 of the Biodiversity Assessment Method 2020 Operational Manual – Stage 2 for information on how to generate the VI scores (see Appendix B). To add a management zone to the assessment, click the icon under ‘Management zones’. The ‘Area’ value is automatically populated based on the area of the vegetation zone. Add a name, then click ‘Add zone’ and then ‘OK’. The sum of the areas of all management zones in a vegetation zone must equal the ‘Area (ha)’ field value for the vegetation zone. If you add a second management zone, enter another name and the area, then correct the area entered for the first management zone so the sum of both management zones is equal to the area of the vegetation zone. Click ‘Add zone’, and then ‘OK’. The management zones are displayed in the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’ section. The composition, structure and function scores can be modified (from zero) for the management zone where only partial loss will occur. 4.3.5 Calculate the future vegetation integrity score In the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’ section, ‘Composition condition score’, ‘Structure condition score’, ‘Function condition score’ and ‘Vegetation integrity (VI) score’ default to a score of zero. The VI score is an estimate of the future condition of the site when compared to the benchmark score. For any area where partial loss (not full loss) is expected to occur, the future VI score can be modified from zero to display the expected VI score after development/clearing. Refer to Subsection 4.1.2 of the Biodiversity Assessment Method 2020 Operational Manual – Stage 2 for information on how to generate future VI scores. To enter an expected future condition score to reflect partial loss of VI, select the ‘Composition condition score’ field. info Tip Unless a partial loss of VI is assumed, there is no need to enter data in the ‘Vegetation Zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’ section. The BAM-C assumes a zero value for future observations. Enter a value greater than zero in the relevant ‘Future mean (x̄)’ fields. Click ‘Recalculate’ to prompt calculation of the composition score for the zone. Click ‘OK’. To enter an expected future condition score to reflect partial loss of VI for structure condition, select the ‘Structure condition score’ field and follow steps 2–4 above. To enter an expected future condition score to reflect partial loss of VI for function condition, select the ‘Function condition score’ field and follow steps 2–4 above. After completing the composition, structure and function condition calculations, the BAM-C will display the future VI score and the change in VI score (the difference between the current and future VI scores). When all required information has been entered, click ‘Next’ to move to Tab 4. info Tip Save your assessment regularly to ensure data is not lost. "

The steps to complete Tab 6 are described below. As ‘Next’ was clicked after completion of Tab 5, the ‘Habitat survey’ tab will be open. When reopening an existing assessment, click on Tab 6 to open it. The list of candidate species from Tab 5 ‘Habitat suitability: Candidate’ that were confirmed as potentially present based on the habitat and geographic limitations are listed in Tab 6. ‘Species presence’ automatically defaults to ‘Yes (surveyed)’. You can change how presence was confirmed using the drop-down. Options are ‘Yes (surveyed)’, ‘Yes (expert report)’ or ‘Yes (assumed present)’. Alternatively, if the species is identified as absent based on either survey or an expert report, options are ‘No (surveyed)’ or ‘No (expert report)’. For a small number of species, the habitat constraint information in the TBDC refers to an important habitat map. If one of these species is being assessed, and the assessment area is within a mapped layer identified on an important habitat map, the species must be considered present (‘Yes (assumed present)’).

The BAM-C uses the loss to VI based on the impact, the area of the vegetation zone, the BRW, and a constant to calculate the number of ecosystem credits for each vegetation zone added at Tab 3. Refer to Equation 1 in the BAM 2020 for more information. info Tip Use the scroll bar to see all ecosystem credits. See BAM 2020, Sections 5.1 and 5.2 for further information on ecosystem credit species. See BAM 2020, Subsections 10.1.1–10.1.2 and 10.2.1 for the calculation method of ecosystem credits. See BAM 2020, Appendix I for more information on BRW. 4.7.7 Species credits for threatened species The second section of Tab 7 displays the species credits for threatened species that have been confirmed present at the site (Tab 6 ‘Species presence’ = ‘Yes’). For species with a UoM of ‘Area’, the BAM-C uses the loss to VI based on the impact, the area of the vegetation zone, the BRW, and a constant to calculate the number of species credits for each vegetation zone (PCT) added at Tab 3 that is associated with the species. Refer to Equation 2 in the BAM 2020 for more information. For species with a UoM of ‘Count’, the BAM-C uses the number of individuals and the BRW to calculate the number of species credits. Refer to Equation 3 in the BAM 2020 for more information. info Tip Use the scroll bar to see all species credits. In some circumstances the TBDC may identify a threatened species that requires assessment for both ecosystem credits and species credits (referred to as dual credit species). For dual credit species, part of the habitat is assessed as a species credit (for example, breeding habitat or land mapped on an important habitat map layer). The remaining habitat for the species is assessed as an ecosystem credit (for example, foraging habitat). Equations for the calculation of species credits differ depending on their UoM. See BAM 2020, Chapter 5 for further information on species credits. See BAM 2020, Subsections 10.1.1, 10.1.3 and 10.2.2 for the calculation method for species credits. See BAM 2020, Appendix I for more information on BRW. No user action is required for Tab 7 and there is no ‘Next’ button. Click on Tab 8 ‘Credit classes’ to open it. "

    "content": "Resources 5. Creating a small area assessment ‘Appendix C: Streamlined assessment module – Small area’ of the BAM 2020 is dedicated to assessing small areas and provides streamlined (simplified) assessment requirements. There are 8 development-type assessments. This chapter in the guide only relates to Part 4/Part 5 small area assessments. Refer to Chapter 4 of this guide for information on assessing general Part 4, Part 5 proposals, major projects, biocertification and general clearing, and Chapter 6 for information on assessing scattered trees. There are limitations on when a small area assessment can be used – all the following requirements must be met: It meets the scheme’s area clearing thresholds, as shown in Table 3 below. Most small area assessments include only one PCT though the BAM-C allows 2 PCTs to be added as long as at least one is a TEC. There is no core koala habitat identified on the Biodiversity Values Map for the proposed site. Core koala habitat is identified in the relevant plan of management under Chapter 4 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Biodiversity and Conservation) 2021 and shown on the Biodiversity Values Map. There is one dominant PCT, or there are 2 dominant PCTs, and at least one is a TEC. Note, the small area module can still be applied where the total assessment area meets the small area threshold but there are more than 2 TECs, or more than one PCT (but none are TECs). Add the dominant TEC(s) and/or PCT into the BAM-C, then include all areas of the smaller, non-dominant PCT(s) or TEC(s) into the vegetation zones of the dominant PCT and/or TEC(s). All assessments that do not meet the above requirements must use a different assessment method and tool – refer to Chapter 4 of this guide for the available alternatives.

Reference data version - The revised Eastern NSW PCT Classification has been deployed into the BAM-C, and revisions to the remainder of the state will be rolled out over the coming years. The reference data version may have different options available depending on when the assessment was created and which IBRA region is selected. Instructions are provided for the following scenarios: New assessments inside a revised NSW IBRA region Existing assessments inside a newly revised NSW IBRA region New or existing assessments outside a newly revised NSW IBRA region a. New assessments inside a revised NSW IBRA region All new assessments created after deployment of a revised NSW PCT classification will automatically use the revised NSW PCTs when an associated NSW IBRA region is selected.\nThe only option in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down will be ‘Current classification (live – default)’. b. Existing assessments inside a newly revised NSW IBRA region Reopening ‘Open’, ‘Locked’ or ‘Finalised’ assessments created before deployment of a newly revised NSW PCT classification will trigger an update with the revised NSW PCTs. This will trigger an alert detailing the changes that have occurred in the assessment. info Tip Take a screenshot of the alert showing the updates. Alerts will not display again once the case has been saved. To use legacy PCTs during a transitional period, select the legacy classification in the ‘Reference data version’ drop-down. Alternatively, to use the revised NSW PCTs select ‘Current classification (live – default)’.

The method for recording PCTs and TECs at a site and calculating current vegetation condition of a site is the same for all assessment types. Refer to Chapter 4 of the BAM 2020 for further information. Small area assessments can record a maximum of 2 PCTs. Where 2 PCTs require assessment, at least one PCT must be a TEC to use the small area assessment method. For any assessment that does not meet this requirement, refer to Chapter 4 of this guide for the available alternatives. info Tip Where the total assessment area meets the small area threshold but there are more than 2 TECs, or more than one PCT (but none are TECs), the small area module can still be applied.

Remember to click ‘Next’ to move through the tabs if any changes are made. If the PCT name or number is known, the ‘Plant community type’ field can be added as the first step, which will automatically populate the formation and class fields. If the PCT name or number is not known, use the ‘Formation’ drop-down to select the formation for the required PCT. info Tip If the PCT or number is known, enter this first and the formation and class fields will be populated automatically. Only PCTs associated with the IBRA region and IBRA subregion will be available. Refer to the webpage About BioNet Vegetation Classification (Veg-C) for further information about PCTs and TECs (see Appendix B). Use the ‘Class’ drop-down (if PCT name or number is not known) to select the required class. The classes available will be filtered to those associated with the formation if a formation was selected in step 3. Use the ‘Plant community type’ drop-down to select the required PCT. The PCTs available will be filtered to those associated with the class if a class was selected in step 4. The % cleared value for the PCT will display under ‘PCT % cleared’. The % cleared value is an estimate of the extent to which a PCT has been cleared since European settlement and is used when assigning a non-threatened PCT to an OTG. info Tip Detailed information on each PCT and its geographic distribution is available as a downloadable and refreshable Power Query from NSW BioNet Resources (see Appendix B). Refer to the Offset rules and ecosystem credits guidance for more information on % cleared and OTGs (see Appendix B). Use the ‘Associated TEC’ drop-down to select the relevant TEC. If no TEC is associated with the PCT, select ‘Not a TEC’. info Tip Only TECs with an association with the selected PCT (in BioNet) are shown in the drop-down. Where a TEC is present at the site but is unavailable in the drop-down list, it may be because the TEC is not associated with the IBRA region and IBRA subregion chosen. A detailed description of each TEC is available through the Threatened biodiversity profile search app (see Appendix B). Detailed information on the PCT to TEC associations and the applicable subregions is available as a downloadable and refreshable Power Query from the NSW BioNet Resources webpage (see Appendix B). ‘BioNet Vegetation Classification’ > ‘Power queries’ > ‘Threatened Ecological Community to Plant Community Types (PCT) Association data’. To request a review of a TEC association, contact the BOS Help Desk.

A vegetation zone record will be added to sections: − ‘Vegetation zones (Current vegetation integrity score)’ − ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’. info Tip Adding a unique condition class name to each vegetation zone will help you distinguish the vegetation zones throughout the assessment, especially when both a TEC and non-TEC have been identified on site for the same PCT. The future VI score fields display the remaining VI values after the development or clearing has occurred at a site. Only edit this section if partial loss of VI is occurring, rather than total loss. For PCTs with multiple vegetation zones, click ‘Add veg zone’ beside the applicable PCT to add another vegetation zone. A zone number will be generated for each vegetation zone and the relevant PCT number for each record displayed. Click ‘Add another PCT’ (if required) and repeat the above steps to add additional PCTs. If the required PCT is missing from the PCT list, click ‘Search PCT outside IBRA’ and enter the name or PCT number to search and then select the PCT. Repeat the above steps for adding vegetation zones. info Tip For small area assessments PCTs are generally restricted to one PCT, however, 2 can be added if at least one is a TEC. You can only add PCTs that are associated with the selected IBRA region when you use the ‘Add Another PCT’ button. With the ‘Search PCT outside IBRA’ button you can add any approved PCT, not only those associated with the selected IBRA region. Some PCTs have no (or incomplete) benchmarks in Veg-C. For these PCTs, an error will display and the PCT cannot be used in the assessment. To delete a PCT or a vegetation zone click the button on the right under ‘Delete’. info Tip Vegetation zone and site data can be imported into the BAM-C in CSV file format (Subsection 5.3.2) or added manually (Subsection 5.3.3). See below for the instructions. 5.3.2 Import vegetation zones To import vegetation zone data, click the import icon beside the vegetation zone. Download the CSV template by selecting ‘this template file’ in the import pop-up and an excel import data template will become available. Open and populate the template with observation values and save the template: − row 1 of the template is reserved for headers − row 2 of the template is reserved for example data − users must enter plot data into the template from row 3 onwards. Select and copy all column headings in rows 1 and 2 and the data from row 3 (and onwards if there is more than one plot). Make sure no blank columns or rows are selected. Click the import icon to reopen the ‘Import data’ pop-up (if not already open). Paste the copied data from the template into the ‘Import data’ pop-up and click ‘Import’. A pop-up will open asking you to confirm that all existing plots will be deleted. Click ‘Yes’ to delete any previous plot data or ‘No’ to cancel and retain the existing plot data. If the import was not successful, or only partially successful, the ‘Import data’ pop-up will display an error message. Correct the error(s) in the CSV file, copy and paste the corrected data, and re-import. Click ‘Close’ to close the pop-up once the data has imported. The data will be imported into the relevant condition score pop-ups and the scores will be calculated automatically. The condition score fields for each condition attribute will change from showing no score (indicated by an ellipsis) to showing a numeric score value. info Tip If assessing a non-woody PCT, do not specify any values for function attributes other than HTW cover in the CSV import file. When copying the data from the template ensure no extra columns are selected or an error will occur. To clear imported data, click the ‘Import’ icon to reopen the ‘Import’ pop-up. Click ‘Clear plots’. All imported data will be cleared, and the condition score fields will revert to displaying no score (‘…’). The above process can be performed for all zones at the site (rather than on a zone-by-zone basis) using ‘Import site’ and following the same process outlined in steps 1–12 above. Individual zones can be removed by clicking the button on the right under ‘Delete’. 5.3.3 Manually enter vegetation zone data This section describes how to manually enter the vegetation zone data into the BAM-C to calculate the VI score. 1. The ‘PCT code’ field is populated automatically when ‘Add veg zone’ is clicked. 2. Select ‘Condition class’ and enter a condition class label for the zone. The name must not include spaces, but hyphens or underscores can be used as an alternative (for example, do not enter ‘Mod TEC’, instead use ‘Mod-TEC’ or ‘Mod_TEC’). info Tip Zone condition class is solely a label to help identify the zone and does not have any influence on VI or credit calculations. 3. A vegetation zone name will be generated automatically based on the condition class and PCT code and displays under the ‘Vegetation zone name’ heading. 4. Select ‘Patch Size’ and enter the relevant patch size area (in hectares) for the zone. info Tip The patch size value is used to filter the list of fauna species presented in the predicted and candidate species tabs. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 4.3.2 for more information on patch size. Making changes to the ‘patch size’ value may affect data in the ‘Habitat suitability’, ‘Habitat survey’, ‘Credits’ and ‘Credit classes’ tabs. 5. Enter the area for the vegetation zone in the ‘Area (ha)’ field. info Tip The area of a vegetation zone will determine the number of plots required. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 4.3.4 (Table 3). The BAM-C automatically adds the number of plots required based on the ‘Area (ha)’ entered. Ensure there is at least one vegetation zone for each PCT. Use the scroll bar to the right of the vegetation zone list to confirm each PCT has a vegetation zone. The minimum vegetation zone ‘Area (ha)’ accepted is 0.01 ha. If an area is smaller than this, the BAM-C will automatically round it up to 0.01 ha (values of 0.005–0.009 ha will be rounded up). If the area is less than 0.005 ha, consider adding the area to another vegetation zone. The ‘Patch size’ should be equal to or greater than the ‘Area (ha)’ size (when the total ‘Area’ of the vegetation zone). 6. Click the ‘Location’ icon and add plot location details. 7. If additional plots are required, click ‘Add plot’. Once the required plot data has been added click ‘OK’. Note that adding a plot to the ‘Location’ field will also add a plot to the ‘Composition’, ‘Structure’ and ‘Function’ condition score fields. 8. Select ‘Composition condition score’ and enter composition data. 9. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update calculation of the composition score for the zone, or ‘OK’ to update and close the composition score pop-up. 10. Select the ‘Calculation results’ tab on the ‘Zone composition data’ pop-up to see the underlying data used to calculate the score. 11. Click ‘OK ‘. info Tip The following calculations are shown in the composition condition section: Benchmarks – these values indicate benchmark reference values for the vegetation class/IBRA combination of the zone. Observed mean – this is the average of observed values entered for all plots for a specific growth form group. Unweighted composition score – BAM-C calculates and displays the unweighted condition score for the relevant growth form group. This calculation converts observed mean values to continuous unweighted condition scores using a Weibull (continuous probability) distribution. Weighted composition score – BAM-C calculates and displays the weighted condition score for the relevant growth form group. This calculation applies a dynamic weighting based on the proportional contribution of each growth form group benchmark function to the benchmark total function (sum of benchmark function across all growth form groups). Dynamic weighting – The BAM-C calculates and displays a dynamic weighting based on the proportional contribution of each growth form group benchmark condition attribute to the benchmark total condition (sum of benchmark condition attributes across all growth form groups). Weightings for structure and function are calculated using a similar approach. For further information on these weightings and calculations refer to Appendix H of the BAM 2020. For further information on determining the VI score refer to Appendix H of the BAM 2020. 12. Select ‘Structure condition score’ to open the pop-up and repeat steps 8–11 above to calculate the structure score. info Tip The same calculations as those described for composition are performed for structure (see BAM 2020, Appendix H). 13. Select ‘Function condition score’ to open the pop-up and repeat steps 8–11 above to calculate the function score. 14. Select the ‘Calculation results’ tab to see the underlying data used to calculate the score. info Tip Some fields in the function tab will be restricted based on the PCT selected. For example, for grassland PCTs the fields relating to trees will be greyed out. Weightings for function are static rather than dynamic, as defined in BAM 2020, Appendix H.3. Unwanted plot(s) can be removed by deleting them in the ‘Location’ pop-up. If you delete a plot, the applicable plot data will also be deleted from the composition, structure and function fields. 15. After completing the composition, structure and function condition calculations, the current VI score will be displayed. 5.3.4 Calculate vegetation integrity for sites with multiple management zones (optional) Management zones can be added to an assessment to identify areas of a vegetation zone that will have different levels of impact (referred to as partial loss). Refer to Subsection 4.1.2 of the Biodiversity Assessment Method 2020 Operational Manual – Stage 2 for information on generating VI scores for partial loss (see Appendix B). 1. To add a management zone to the assessment, click the icon under ‘Management zones’. 2. The ‘Area’ value is automatically populated based on the area of the vegetation zone. Add a name, then click ‘Add zone’ and then ‘OK’. 3. The sum of the areas of all management zones in a vegetation zone must equal the ‘Area (ha)’ field value for the vegetation zone. If you add a second management zone, enter another name and the area, then correct the area entered for the first management zone so the sum of both management zones is equal to the area of the vegetation zone. Click ‘Add zone’, and then ‘OK’. 4. The management zones are displayed in the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’ section. The composition, structure and function scores can be modified (from zero) for the management zone where only partial loss will occur. 5.3.5 Calculate the future vegetation integrity score In the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score)’ section, ‘Composition condition score’, ‘Structure condition score’, ‘Function condition score’ and ‘Vegetation integrity (VI) score’ default to a score of zero. The VI score is an estimate of the future condition of the site when compared to the benchmark score. For any area where partial loss (not full loss) is expected to occur, the future VI score can be modified from zero to display the expected VI score after development/clearing. Refer to Subsection 4.1.2 of the Biodiversity Assessment Method 2020 Operational Manual – Stage 2 for information on how to generate future VI scores. 1. To enter an expected future condition score to reflect partial loss of VI, select the ‘Composition condition score’ field. info Tip Unless assuming a partial loss of VI, there is no need to enter data in the ‘Future vegetation integrity score’ section. The BAM-C assumes a zero value for future observations. 2. Enter a value greater than zero in the relevant ‘Future mean (x̄)’ fields. 3. Click ‘Recalculate’ to prompt calculation of the composition score for the zone. 4. Click ‘OK’. 5. To enter an expected future condition score to reflect partial loss of VI for structure condition, select the ‘Structure condition score’ field and follow steps 2–4 above. 6. To enter an expected future condition score to reflect partial loss of VI for function condition, select the ‘Function condition score’ field and follow steps 2–4 above. 7. After completing the composition, structure and function calculations, the BAM-C will display the future VI score and the change in VI score (the difference between the current and future VI scores). 8. When all required information has been entered, click ‘Next’ to move to Tab 4. info Tip Save your assessment regularly to ensure data is not lost. "

The BAM-C displays species satisfying these criteria. Criteria for small area assessments are the same as for other development or clearing assessments. You must review the automatically populated information alongside BAM 2020, Subsections 5.2.1–5.2.2 to confirm the predicted species for assessment. The information required in Tab 4 is displayed below. The ‘Habitat suitability: Predicted’ tab will be open if ‘Next’ was clicked on Tab 3. When reopening an assessment with existing information, click on Tab 4 to open it. Review the ‘Habitat constraints’, ‘Geographic limitations’ and ‘Species is vagrant’ checkboxes relevant to each species to confirm that the indicated options are relevant to the site (BAM 2020, Subsections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2): If the indicated ‘Habitat constraints’ or ‘Geographic limitations’ options are not relevant, the box should be unchecked. In limited circumstances, a species may appear in the populated list due to a vagrant individual recorded in the IBRA subregion. In most cases, vagrant sightings will be marked as such on the BioNet Atlas and will not be included in the BAM-C. If you are confident a species is displaying in the populated list due to a vagrant BioNet Atlas record, the checkbox should be ticked. Note: An asterisk beside a species name indicates the species has been added to the assessment, either as a new assessment or because of a change to a previous tab, for example, a change to PCT(s), % native vegetation cover or patch size. info Tip Further details on habitat constraints (including ‘other’ category) and geographic limitations are on the BioNet Threatened Biodiversity Profiles webpage (see Appendix B). If you are confident a species is displaying in the populated list due to a vagrant BioNet Atlas record, tick the ‘Species is vagrant’ checkbox. Please send supporting justification to the BOS Help Desk so the species can be reviewed. Hover over the information icon to see cross-references to information available in the BAM for ‘Species is vagrant’, ‘Veg Zone – Confirmed predicted species’ and ‘Sensitivity to gain’. The ‘Confirmed predicted species’ default setting for development/clearing assessments is ‘Yes’ if: all indicated ‘Geographic limitations’ and ‘Habitat constraints’ remain checked ‘Species is vagrant’ is unchecked. If a predicted species has habitat constraint(s) and is associated with more than one vegetation zone, the BAM-C displays a habitat constraint for each zone, allowing you to retain a constraint for one zone and not another. Any geographic limitation applies to all zones. info Tip Confirmed predicted species are assessed for ecosystem credits. The ‘Sensitivity to gain class’, ‘BC Act listing status’ and ‘EPBC Act listing status’ will populate automatically but Tab 4 does not display the species’ SAII status. To add an ecosystem credit species that is not in the list generated by the BAM-C, click ‘Search predicted species’ at the bottom of the page, and enter the species’ name or profile ID. Any matching species will be presented in a list. Select the species’ name and click ‘Add predicted species’. When a species is added, an ‘X’ will appear to the left of the species’ name, indicating this species has been added by the assessor. This species can be removed by clicking on the ‘X’.

The steps to complete Tab 6 are described below. As ‘Next’ was clicked after completion of Tab 5, the ‘Habitat survey’ tab will be open. When reopening an existing assessment, click on Tab 6 to open it. The list of candidate species from Tab 5 ‘Habitat suitability: Candidate’ that were confirmed as potentially present based on the habitat and geographic limitations are listed in Tab 6. This includes any species that were manually added to Tab 5. ‘Species presence’ automatically defaults to ‘Yes (surveyed)’. You can change how presence was confirmed using the drop-down. Options are ‘Yes (surveyed)’, ‘Yes (expert report)’ or ‘Yes (assumed present)’. Alternatively, if the species is identified as absent based on either survey or an expert report, options are ‘No (surveyed)’ or ‘No (expert report)’. For a small number of species, the habitat constraint information in the TBDC refers to an important habitat map. If one of these species is being assessed, and the assessment area is wholly or partially within a mapped layer identified on an important habitat map, the species must be considered present (‘Yes (assumed present)’). If the assessment area does not overlap any mapped layer, the species credit species is considered absent (‘No (surveyed)’). Include reference to the important habitat map in the BAR. info Tip Where ‘Yes (surveyed)’, Yes (expert report)’ or ‘Yes (assumed present)’ has been selected, the ‘Veg Zone and Value’ column becomes editable. If a species was surveyed for, use the checkboxes in the ‘Survey timetable’ field to indicate when the survey(s) were undertaken. The survey method must comply with any threatened species survey guides or advice that the department has published or provided within the TBDC. In the absence of any guide or advice, use a best-practice method. Only survey during a month specified in the BAM-C unless there is a clear justification to survey outside the specified month(s). If the survey was conducted during a month outside the specified month(s), select ‘Survey month outside the specified months’, then use the checkboxes to indicate the month(s) that the survey was undertaken. If ‘Yes (expert report)’, ‘Yes (assumed present)’ or ‘No (expert report)’ is selected in the ‘Species presence’ field, there is no option to select a month. The UoM, ‘Biodiversity risk’ and ‘Biodiversity risk weighting’ for each species is displayed but cannot be edited. For each species identified as present, tick the checkboxes under ‘Veg Zone & Value’ for all vegetation zones the species has been identified as being present within. info Tip See BAM 2020, Appendix I for further information on BRW. A species can be identified as present in multiple vegetation zones. Enter the value that quantifies the species’ distribution, noting that the value entered will differ depending on the UoM: Where the UoM is ‘Area (ha)’ enter the area of the species polygon. The development of the polygon must comply with any threatened species survey guides or advice that the department has published or provided within the TBDC. In the absence of any guide or advice, use best practice. If the assessment area is wholly or partially within a mapped layer identified on an important habitat map, the species polygon must include the entire area of the zone that is mapped on the important habitat map. Where the UoM is ‘Count’, enter the number of individuals within the species polygon (an individual is defined in the BAM 2020 as ‘a single, mature organism that is a threatened species’). info Tip The minimum area that can be entered in BAM-C is 0.01 ha. If the area is between 0.005 ha and 0.009 ha the BAM-C will round the value up to 0.01 ha. Below 0.005 ha, values will be rounded to 0 ha and the assessment will not save.

On this page 5.7.6 Ecosystem credits for PCTs, TECs and threatened species habitat 5.7.7 Species credits for threatened species 5.7.6 Ecosystem credits for PCTs, TECs and threatened species habitat The first section of Tab 7 displays the ecosystem credits for the PCTs and TECs. The ecosystem credits are calculated by applying the ‘Sensitivity to loss’ of the PCT or TEC and the highest ‘Sensitivity to gain’ of the ecosystem credit (predicted) species assumed to be present at Tab 4 (‘Veg Zone – Confirmed predicted species’ = ‘Yes’). Where a PCT or TEC provides no habitat for ecosystem credit species, the BAM-C adopts a ‘Sensitivity to gain’ of ‘Low’. Refer to the BAM 2020, Appendix I for more information. The BAM-C uses the loss to VI based on the impact, the area of the vegetation zone, the BRW, and a constant, to calculate the number of ecosystem credits for each vegetation zone added at Tab 3.

For species with a UoM of ‘Area’, the BAM-C uses the loss to VI based on the impact, the area of the vegetation zone, the BRW, and a constant, to calculate the number of species credits for each vegetation zone (PCT) added at Tab 3 that is associated with the species. Refer to Equation 2 in the BAM 2020 for more information. For species with a UoM of ‘Count’, the BAM-C uses the number of individuals and the BRW to calculate the number of species credits. Refer to Equation 3 in the BAM 2020 for more information. info Tip Use the scroll bar to see all species credits. In some circumstances, the TBDC may identify a threatened species that requires assessment for both ecosystem credits and species credits (referred to as dual credit species). For dual credit species, part of the habitat is assessed as a species credit (for example, breeding habitat or land mapped on an important habitat map layer). The remaining habitat for the species is assessed as an ecosystem credit (for example, foraging habitat). Equations for the calculation of species credits differ depending on their UoM. See BAM 2020, Chapter 5 for further information on species credits. See BAM 2020, Subsections 10.1.1, 10.1.3 and 10.2.2 for the calculation method for species credits.

Creating a scattered trees assessment ‘Appendix B: Streamlined assessment module – Scattered trees assessment’ of the BAM 2020 is dedicated to assessing trees that meet the definition of ‘scattered’ and provides streamlined (simplified) assessment requirements. There are 8 development-type assessments. This chapter only relates to scattered tree assessments. Refer to Chapter 4 for information on assessing general Part 4, Part 5 proposals, major projects, biocertification and general clearing, and Chapter 5 for information on assessing small areas. There are limitations on when a scattered tree assessment can be used – all the following requirements must be met: It meets the BAM 2020 definition of scattered trees, refer to Section 6.1 below for more information. None of the trees are listed as a threatened species under either the BC Act or EPBC Act. None of the trees provide habitat for candidate (species credit) species (flora or fauna) in accordance with BAM 2020, Chapter 5. This includes species from the candidate species list populated by the BAM-C or any species incidentally observed (or evidence, such as scats or shells) using a tree as habitat. None of the trees provide habitat for predicted (ecosystem credit) fauna species in accordance with BAM 2020, Chapter 5, that are at risk of a SAII. No part of the canopy of any tree being assessed overlaps a mapped layer on the Biodiversity Values Map, important habitat maps, or the sensitive or vulnerable land layers on the Native Vegetation Regulatory Map. There are no shrubs or tree regrowth (less than 5 cm DBH) within the area of assessment. Any native species in the ground cover layer of the assessment area must be listed on the widely cultivated native species list, noting that assessment should be made during the time of year when the proportion of native ground cover is likely to be at its maximum compared to that of exotic ground cover. Refer to Streamlined assessment module planted native vegetation for the species list (see Appendix B). If any of the above limitations are not met, a different assessment pathway must be used to assess the trees. Refer to Chapters 4 and 5 of this guide for alternative development assessment types. When entering data in each tab, proceed to the next tab by using the ‘Next’ button at the bottom of the page. The data added then flows through to the next tab in the BAM-C. info Tip If the vegetation in the area being assessed as scattered trees does not meet one or more of the scattered tree limitations listed above, use another assessment type in the BAM-C.

If the PCT name or number is not known, use the ‘Formation’ drop-down to select the formation for the PCT. info Tip If the PCT or number is known, enter this first, and the formation and class fields will be populated automatically. Only PCTs associated with the IBRA region and IBRA subregion will be available. Refer to the webpage About BioNet Vegetation Classification (Veg-C) for further information about PCTs and TECs (see Appendix B). Use the ‘Class’ drop-down (if PCT name or number is not known) to select the required class. The classes available will be filtered to those associated with the formation if a formation was selected in step 3. Use the ‘Plant community type’ drop-down to select the required PCT. The PCTs available will be filtered to those associated with the class if a class was selected in step 4. The % cleared value for the PCT will be displayed under ‘PCT % cleared’. The % cleared value is an estimate of the extent to which a PCT has been cleared since European settlement and is used when assigning a non-threatened PCT to an OTG. info Tip Detailed information on each PCT and its geographic distribution is available as a downloadable and refreshable Power Query from NSW BioNet Resources (see Appendix B), ‘BioNet Vegetation Classification’ > ‘Power Queries’ > ‘Plant Community Type data’. Refer to the Offset rules and ecosystem credits guidance for more information on % cleared and OTGs (see Appendix B). Select the ‘Associated TEC’ drop-down. If the scattered trees are part of a TEC, select the relevant TEC. Select ' Not a TEC ' if no TEC is associated with the PCT. Adding a TEC has no impact on the number of credits generated but will affect the offsetting requirements. info Tip Only TECs associated with the selected PCT (in BioNet) are shown in the drop-down. Where a TEC is present at the site but is unavailable in the drop-down list, it may be because the TEC is not associated with the IBRA region and IBRA subregion chosen. A detailed description of each TEC is available through the Threatened biodiversity profile search app (see Appendix B). Detailed information on the PCT to TEC associations and the applicable subregions is available as a downloadable and refreshable Power Query from the NSW BioNet Resources webpage (see Appendix B). ‘BioNet Vegetation Classification’ > ‘Power queries’ > ‘Threatened Ecological Community to Plant Community Types (PCT) Association data’. If a scattered tree is identified as a threatened species, you cannot use the scattered trees module. The state and Commonwealth listing status of a TEC will be displayed under the ‘BC Act listing status’ and ‘EPBC Act listing status’ headings, respectively. Click ‘Add PCT Group’. Where there is more than one tree being assessed, the trees will need to be split into multiple PCT groups where: − there are different tree species being assessed − the tree species falls into different tree classes as per Table 11 of the BAM 2020. To add another PCT group for a PCT, click ‘Add PCT group’ again, beside the applicable PCT. A scattered trees PCT group record will be added to the ‘Scattered tree PCT Groups’ section. Click ‘Add another PCT’ (if required) and repeat the above steps to add additional PCTs. If the required PCT is missing from the PCT list, click ‘Search PCT outside IBRA’, enter the name or PCT number to search, and then select the PCT. Repeat the above steps for adding PCT groups. info Tip You can only add PCTs that are associated with the selected IBRA region when you use the ‘Add Another PCT’ button. With the ‘Search PCT outside IBRA’ button you can add any approved PCT, not only those associated with the selected IBRA region. Some PCTs have no (or incomplete) benchmarks in Veg-C. For these PCTs, an error will be displayed, and the PCT cannot be used in the assessment. To delete a PCT or a scattered tree PCT group, click the button on the right under ‘Delete’. 6.3.2 Scattered tree PCT groups The BAM 2020, Appendix B.5 states that every class 2 and class 3 scattered tree needs to be assessed to determine whether it is an HBT. All trees with hollows need to be clearly identified on a map. The offset requirements for scattered trees differ depending on the tree class (including whether it contains hollows or not). Refer to the BAM 2020, Table 11 for more information. Separate scattered tree PCT groups must be created for each tree species. After ‘Add PCT Group’ for a PCT is clicked a record will be created under ‘Scattered tree PCT Groups’. A tree group number will be generated, and the relevant PCT number for each group is displayed. For each scattered tree PCT group added, select the ‘Species’ field and search for the tree species associated with the PCT for that group. Species identified as being associated with the PCT will be marked with an asterisk and will appear at the top of the species list. You can confirm which tree species are associated with the PCT from within BioNet Veg-C. A warning pop-up will appear if the species selected is not associated with the selected PCT. If the selected species is a species credit species (a threatened species), it cannot be assessed using the scattered trees module and a warning pop-up will appear. info Tip If a scattered tree is identified as a threatened species, you cannot use the scattered trees module. The benchmark ‘Large tree threshold size’ for the PCT will be displayed based on the PCT benchmark information in Veg-C. This will be the largest ‘DBHOB category’. The large tree threshold size value can be modified by selecting ‘Modify default benchmarks’ under ‘Add PCT group’. Click ‘Unlock’, then modify the large tree threshold size. Click ‘Update‘ to confirm the change, or ‘Cancel’ to retain the original threshold size. Use the ‘DBHOB category’ drop-down to select the DBH category that applies to the tree group. If the tree group contains trees that meet more than one DBHOB category you should split the trees into separate groups and assess each separately. Tick the ‘Contains hollows’ checkbox if the trees contain hollows. If the tree group contains some trees with hollows (regardless of size) and some without, you should split the trees into separate groups and assess each separately. Enter the number of trees in the tree group in the ‘No. of trees’ column. ‘Negligible biodiversity value’ for the tree group will populate automatically with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’, depending on previous selections. Refer to the BAM 2020, Table 11, for more information. The class value of the tree group will populate automatically with ‘1’, ‘2’ or ‘3’, depending on previous selections. Refer to the BAM 2020, Table 11, for more information. Based on the class of the tree group, the BAM-C will identify if further assessment is required. Refer to the BAM 2020, Appendix B.3 and Table 11 for more information. info Tip Save your assessment regularly to ensure data is not lost. Refer to BAM 2020, Appendix B.5 for more information on the classes, and calculating the offset requirements for scattered trees. Repeat the above steps for all PCT groups. If you need to delete the data for a PCT group, click the button on the right under ‘Delete’. When all required information has been entered, click ‘Next’ to move to Tab 4. "

The candidate species list is populated automatically based on criteria in the BAM 2020 (Subsection 5.2.1, Step 1) but is limited to displaying species that are at risk of an SAII. Any additional threatened species that are identified on the site (that is, incidentally observed during a site visit) must be manually added to the species list at Tab 5. You must review the automatically populated information alongside the BAM 2020, Subsections 5.1.2–5.2.3 to confirm the candidate species for assessment.

When reopening an existing assessment, click on Tab 5 to open it. info Tip Scattered tree assessments will only display species credit species at risk of an SAII. Refer to Serious and irreversible impacts of development on biodiversity for the current species SAII list (see Appendix B). Review the ‘Habitat constraints’, ‘Habitat degraded’, ‘Geographic limitations’ and ‘Species is vagrant’ checkboxes relevant to each species to confirm that the indicated options are relevant to the site (BAM 2020, Subsections 5.2.1–5.2.3): If the indicated ‘Habitat constraints’ or ‘Geographic limitations’ options are not relevant, the box should be unchecked. If the ‘Habitat degraded’ option is relevant, the box should be checked. In limited circumstances, a species may appear in the populated list due to a vagrant individual recorded in the IBRA subregion. In most cases, vagrant sightings will be marked as such on the BioNet Atlas and will not be included in the BAM-C. If you are confident a species is displaying in the populated list due to a vagrant BioNet Atlas record, tick the ‘Species is vagrant’ checkbox. Note: An asterisk beside a species name indicates the species has been added to the assessment because of a change to a previous tab, for example, a change to PCT(s), % native vegetation cover, or patch size. info Tip If you are confident a species is displaying in the populated list due to a vagrant BioNet Atlas record, tick the ‘Species is vagrant’ checkbox.

To delete a PCT or a vegetation zone click the button on the right under ‘Delete’. info Tip Vegetation zone and site data can be imported into the BAM-C in CSV file format (see Subsection 7.3.2) or added manually (see Subsection 7.3.3). See below for instructions. 7.3.2 Import vegetation zones To import vegetation zone data, click the import icon beside the vegetation zone. Download the CSV template by selecting ‘this template file’ in the import pop-up and an excel import data template will become available. Open and populate the template with observation values and save the template: row 1 of the template is reserved for headers row 2 of the template is reserved for example data users must enter plot data into the template from row 3 onwards. Data for additional plots (for the same vegetation zone) can be imported by adding plot data to rows 4 onwards. Select and copy all column headings in rows 1 and 2 and the data from row 3 (and onwards if there is more than one plot). Make sure that no blank columns or rows are selected. Click the import icon to reopen the ‘Import data’ pop-up (if not already open). Paste the copied data from the template into the ‘Import data’ pop-up and click ‘Import’. A pop-up will open asking you to confirm that all existing plots will be deleted. Click ‘Yes’ to delete any previous plot data or ‘No’ to cancel and retain the existing plot data. If the import was unsuccessful or only partially successful, the ‘Import data’ pop-up will display an error message. Correct the error(s) in the CSV file, then copy and paste the corrected data, and re-import. Click ‘Close’. The data will be imported into the relevant condition score pop-up fields and the scores will be calculated automatically. The condition score fields for each attribute will change from showing no score (indicated by an ellipsis) to a numeric score value. info Tip If assessing a non-woody PCT, do not specify any values for function attributes other than HTW cover in the CSV import file. When copying the data from the template, ensure no extra columns are selected or an error will occur. The import template will not create management zones or detect all types of high risk lands. If the import template is used, ensure these fields are manually completed if relevant. To clear imported data, click the ‘Import’ icon to reopen the ‘Import’ pop-up. Click ‘Clear plots’. All imported data will be cleared and the condition score fields will revert to displaying no score (‘…’). The above process can be performed for all zones at the site (rather than on a zone-by-zone basis) using the ‘Import site’ button and following the same process outlined in steps 1–12 above. Individual zones can be removed by clicking the button on the right under ‘Delete’. 7.3.3 Manually enter vegetation zone data This section describes how to manually enter the vegetation zone data into the BAM-C to calculate the current VI score. 1. The ‘PCT code’ field is populated automatically when the ‘Add veg zone’ is clicked. 2. Select ‘Condition class’ and enter a condition class label for the zone. The name must not include spaces, but hyphens or underscores can be used as an alternative (for example, do not enter ‘Mod TEC’, instead use ‘Mod-TEC’ or ‘Mod_TEC’). info Tip Zone condition class is solely a label to help identify the zone and does not influence VI or credit calculations. 3. A vegetation zone name will be generated automatically based on the condition class and PCT code and displays under the ‘Vegetation zone name’ heading. 4. Select ‘Patch Size’ and enter the relevant patch size area (in hectares) for the zone. info Tip The patch size value is used to filter the list of fauna species presented in the predicted and candidate species tabs. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 4.3.2 for more information on patch size. Making changes to the ‘patch size’ value may affect data in the ‘Habitat suitability’, ‘Habitat survey’, ‘Credits’ and ‘Credit classes’ tabs. 5. Enter the area for the vegetation zone in the ‘Area (ha)’ field. 6. The BAM-C will automatically select ‘High risk lands’ if the site is located in an NSW (Mitchell) landscape that is ≥30% cleared, or the native vegetation is listed as an endangered or critically endangered community. However, you can also tick the ‘High risk lands’ checkbox if the site meets other criteria identified in BAM 2020, Subsection 11.4.1(6a–f). info Tip The area of a vegetation zone will determine the number of plots required. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 4.3.4 (Table 3). The BAM-C automatically adds the number of plots required based on the ‘Area (ha)’ entered. Ensure there is at least one vegetation zone for each PCT. Use the scroll bar to the right of the vegetation zone list to confirm each PCT has a vegetation zone. The minimum vegetation zone ‘Area (ha)’ is 0.01 ha. If a zone is smaller than 0.01 ha, the BAM-C will automatically round-up the area to 0.01 ha (values of 0.005–0.009 ha will be rounded up). If the area is less than 0.005 ha, consider adding the area to another vegetation zone. The ‘Patch size’ should be equal to or greater than the ‘Area (ha)’ size (when the total ‘Area’ of the vegetation zone represents native vegetation). 7. Click the ‘Location’ icon and add plot location details. 8. If additional plots are required, click ‘Add plot’. Once the required plot data has been added click ‘OK’. Note that adding a plot to the ‘Location’ field will also add a plot to the ‘Composition’, ‘Structure’ and ‘Function’ condition score fields. 9. Select ‘Composition condition score’ and enter composition data. 10. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update calculation of the composition score for the zone, or ‘OK’ to update and close the composition score pop-up. 11. Select the ‘Calculation results’ tab on the ‘Zone composition data’ pop-up to see the underlying data used to calculate the score. 12. Click ‘OK’. info Tip The following calculations are shown in the zone: Benchmarks – these values indicate benchmark reference values for the vegetation class/IBRA combination of the zone. Observed mean – this is the average of observed values entered for all plots for a specific growth form group. Unweighted composition score – BAM-C calculates and displays the unweighted condition score for the relevant growth form group. This calculation converts observed mean values to continuous unweighted condition scores using a Weibull (continuous probability) distribution. Weighted composition score – BAM-C calculates and displays the weighted condition score for the relevant growth form group. This calculation applies a dynamic weighting based on the proportional contribution of each growth form group benchmark function to the benchmark total function (sum of benchmark function across all growth form groups). Dynamic weighting – BAM-C calculates and displays a dynamic weighting based on the proportional contribution of each growth form group benchmark condition attribute to the benchmark total condition (sum of benchmark condition attributes across all growth form groups). Weightings for structure and function are calculated using a similar approach. For further information on these weightings and calculations refer to Appendix H of the BAM 2020. For further information on determining the VI score refer to Appendix H of the BAM 2020. 13. Select ‘Structure condition score’ to open the pop-up and repeat steps 9–12 to calculate the structure score. info Tip The same calculations as those described for composition are performed for structure (see BAM 2020, Appendix H). 14. Select ‘Function condition score’ to open the pop-up and repeat steps 9–12 to calculate the function score. 15. Select the ‘Calculation results’ tab to see the underlying data used to calculate the score. info Tip Some fields in the function tab will be restricted based on the PCT selected. For example, for grassland PCTs the fields relating to trees will be greyed out. Weightings for function are static rather than dynamic, as defined in BAM 2020, Appendix H.3. Unwanted plot(s) can be removed by deleting them in the ‘Location’ pop-up. If you delete a plot, the applicable plot data will also be deleted from the composition, structure and function fields. 16. After completing the composition, structure and function calculations, the current VI score will be displayed. 7.3.4 Calculate vegetation integrity for sites with multiple management zones (optional) Management zones can be added to an assessment to identify areas of a vegetation zone that will have different levels or types of management. To add a management zone to the assessment, click the icon under ‘Management zones’. The ‘Area’ value is automatically populated based on the area of the vegetation zone. Add a name, then click ‘Add zone’ and then ‘OK’. The sum of the areas of all management zones in a vegetation zone must equal the ‘Area (ha)’ field value for the vegetation zone. If you add a second management zone, enter another name and the area, then correct the area entered for the first management zone so the sum of both management zones is equal to the area of the vegetation zone. Click ‘Add zone’, and then ‘OK’. The management zones are displayed in the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity (VI) score, with management)’ section. The composition, structure and function scores can then be modified based on the management differences, for example, with and without active restoration. 7.3.5 Calculate the future vegetation integrity score, without management In the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score, without management)’ section, ‘Composition condition score’, ‘Structure condition score’, ‘Function condition score’ and ‘VI score’ will populate automatically. The calculation of these values is dependent on the annual rates of decline for the VI attributes, the presence of HTW, and the risk category of the land. Refer to the Biodiversity Assessment Method Operational Manual – Stage 3, Subsection 2.2.1 for more information on averted loss, and the homepage of the BAM-C for the intrinsic rates of increase and annual rate of decline (see Appendix B). In some instances, the composition score can be modified when HTW are present. For more information, refer to the ‘Annual rate of decline’ tab within the Rates of increase/rates of decline document on the homepage of the BAM-C. Select the 'Composition condition score' to modify the default composition condition rate of decline. To modify the default rate of decline, click ‘Modify default rate of decline’. Data input fields under the default rate of decline row will be displayed. Click ‘Unlock’, enter the required modified rate of decline, and then click ‘Update’ to set the new rate of decline. info Tip You can vary the annual rate of decline for an attribute in circumstances defined in the Intrinsic rates of increase/annual rate of decline table provided in the BAM-C ‘Information’ tab. Refer to the BAM 2020, Section 11.4 for more information. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update the calculations or ‘OK’ to update and close the pop-up. info Tip The following calculations are shown in this pop-up: Rate of decline: the annual rate of decline for the growth form group. See BAM 2020, Chapter 11. The BAM-C calculates and displays the predicted future condition (composition/structure/function) value for the growth form group. This calculation reapplies the logistic growth curve (Weibull curve) and the dynamic weighting approach to the attribute value without management to determine the future predicted condition score for composition, structure and function. See BAM 2020, Appendix H, Equations 28–30. These equations are used to calculate the future VI score without management. In some instances, the structure score may be modified when HTW are present. For more information, refer to the ‘Annual rate of decline’ tab within the Rates of increase/rates of decline document on the homepage of the BAM-C. To modify the default structure condition rate of decline, select the ‘Structure condition score’. Click ‘Modify default rate of decline’. Data input fields under the default ‘Rate of decline’ row will be displayed. Click ‘Unlock’, enter the modified rate of decline, and then click ‘Update’ to confirm the new rate of decline. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update the calculations, or ‘OK’ to update and close the pop-up. To modify the default rate of decline for function condition select ‘Function condition score’. Click ‘Modify default rate of decline’. Data input fields under the default rate of decline row will be displayed. Click ‘Unlock’, enter the required modified rate of decline, and click ‘Update’ to confirm the new rate of decline. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update the calculations, or ‘OK’ to update and close the pop-up. After completing the composition, structure and function calculations, the future VI score after 20 years without management is calculated and displayed in the ‘VI score’ field. The changes in VI between current and future without management scores (also known as averted loss) will be displayed in the ‘Total change in VI score’ column. 7.3.6 Calculate the future vegetation integrity score, with management In the ‘Vegetation zones (Future vegetation integrity score, with management’) section, the ‘composition condition score’, ‘structure condition score’ and ‘function condition score’ will be calculated automatically and displayed. These can be modified, where appropriate, if active restoration is being undertaken. The ‘Security Benefit Score’ and ‘VI score’ will also be calculated and displayed but cannot be modified. The ‘High Threat Weed Cover’ and ‘CL or conservation obligation’ fields are editable. The current list of HTW is published on the homepage of the BAM-C as a BioNet Power Query export from the BioNet Species Names database. Each HTW is categorised as either ‘manageable’ or ‘not manageable’, and this categorisation is displayed in the BioNet Power Query. Where ‘manageable’ HTW occur in the vegetation zone and they will be actively managed, as detailed in the management plan, plus there is evidence to support their successful control, the HTW score may be modified to display only the percentage of ‘non-manageable’ HTW. Refer to BAM 2020, Appendix G.7.6, and Subsection 2.2.2 of the Biodiversity Assessment Method Operational Manual – Stage 3 for more information: Tick the ‘High Threat Weed Cover’ checkbox, which unlocks the field. Edit the HTW value to display the percentage cover of ‘non-manageable’ HTW plus any ‘manageable’ HTW not being actively managed. If the condition score fields already contain data, these will automatically update based on the revised risk weighting for HTW as outlined in BAM 2020, Equations 35 and 36. Note, the values contributing to the composition and structure scores should be unlocked and modified to reflect the predicted outcomes of the active management being undertaken. For instructions, refer to the steps below. Where active restoration is being undertaken, it may be appropriate to modify the ‘Future value with active restoration gain’ for one or more growth form groups in the zone composition data fields. Refer to BAM 2020, Subsection 11.3.2 for more information. To alter the composition score, select the ‘Composition condition score’ field and click ‘Unlock’ under ‘Future value with active restoration gain’. Data input fields for capturing future value with active restoration gain will become editable. Enter the proposed future value and click ‘Lock’ to update the proposed value. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update the calculations, or ‘OK to update and close the pop-up. info Tip The BAM-C calculates and displays the current mean of observed values of the relevant growth form group over all plots (from the ‘Current vegetation integrity score’ pop-up). Equation 25 or Equation 26 is then used to calculate the future VI score with management. See BAM 2020, Appendix H: Determining the vegetation integrity score. Where active restoration is being undertaken, it may be appropriate to modify the ‘Future value with active restoration gain’ for one or more growth form groups in the zone structure data fields. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 11.3.2 for more information. To alter the structure score, select the structure condition score and click ‘Unlock’ under ‘Future value with active restoration gain’. Data input fields for specifying future value with active restoration gain will be enabled. Enter the proposed future value and click ‘Lock’ to update the proposed value. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update the calculations, or ‘OK’ to update and close the pop-up. Where active restoration is being undertaken, it may be appropriate to modify the ‘Future value with active restoration gain’ for one or more function attributes. Refer to the BAM 2020, Subsection 11.3.2 for more information. To alter the function score, select the function condition score and click ‘Unlock’ under ‘Future value with active restoration gain’. Data input fields for specifying future value with active restoration gain will be enabled. Enter the proposed future value and click ‘Lock’ to update the proposed value. Click ‘Recalculate’ to update the calculations, or ‘OK’ to update and close the pop-up. After completing the composition, structure and function calculations, the future VI score (with management), security benefit score, change in VI scores between current and future with management, and total gain will be displayed. The ‘Security Benefit Score’ will be applied if the vegetation zone meets the criteria set out in the BAM, Section 11.5, that it: has a current VI score of ≥60 has a current HTW cover of ≤10% is not already secured under an existing conservation obligation is not Crown land. Tick the ‘CL [Crown land] or conservation obligation’ checkbox if appropriate. Refer to the BAM 2020, Section 11.9, to identify the types of actions or measures that are applicable. info Tip Definitions relating to existing conservation obligations and management actions: ‘Existing conservation obligation’ does not include management actions that are undertaken voluntarily and are not secured by any legal obligation. ‘Publicly owned land’ means land owned by, or under the control of, the state, the Commonwealth or a public authority under a long-term lease, licence, or other arrangement. It does not include land that is under a perpetual lease, or land that is being managed by a person or a body (other than the state, the Commonwealth, or a public authority). See BAM 2020, Section 11.9. When all required information has been entered, click ‘Next’ to move to Tab 4. info Tip The security benefit score is an addition to the overall gain achieved at a site and is applied to zones in high to very high condition.

For species with a UoM of ‘Area’, the BAM-C uses the VI gain, the area of the vegetation zone, and a constant, to calculate the number of species credits for each vegetation zone (PCT) added at Tab 3 that is associated with the species. Refer to Equation 5 in the BAM 2020 for more information. For species with a UoM of ‘Count’, the BAM-C uses the number of individuals, the estimated intrinsic rate of increase for the species, and the management timeframe (20 years) to calculate the number of species credits. Refer to Equation 6 in the BAM 2020 for more information. info Tip Use the scroll bar to see all species credits. In some circumstances, the TBDC may identify a threatened species that requires assessment for ecosystem credits and species credits (referred to as dual credit species). For dual credit species, part of the habitat is assessed as a species credit (for example, breeding habitat or land mapped on an important habitat map layer). The remaining habitat for the species is assessed as an ecosystem credit (for example, foraging habitat). Equations for the calculation of species credits differ depending on their UoM.
